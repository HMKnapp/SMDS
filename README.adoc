== SMDS - Sane MacOS Dev Setup

Is a collection of scripts to install sane default development tools on MacOS without requiring admin privileges.

MacOS has some insanely outdated software by default, e.g.

[source,bash]
----
/bin/bash --version
GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin19)
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
----

*SMDS* first installs _homebrew_, then uses it to install/upgrade

* bash
* go
* node
* ruby

It adds the required `ENV` variables and `PATH` for _zsh_ and _bash_ for them to work in userspace.
